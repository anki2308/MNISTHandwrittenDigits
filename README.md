# MNISTHandwrittenDigits

- Handwritten digit recognition is the process to provide the ability to machines to recognize human handwritten digits. It is not an easy task for the machine 
because handwritten digits are not perfect, vary from person-to-person, and can be made with many different flavors.
- The MNIST dataset for the implementation of a handwritten digit recognition app. To implement this we will use a special type of deep neural network called 
Convolutional Neural Networks.
